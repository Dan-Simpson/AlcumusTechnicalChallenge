This project assumes you have the following installed

Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Cypress (use the command 'npm install cypress --save-dev')

Github would not allow the node_modules files to be uploaded so once the repo has been cloned.

Open the repo folder and run 'npm install' inside the repo folder to install the latest node packages.

The tests are found in the cypress > integration folder.
